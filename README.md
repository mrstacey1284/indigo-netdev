haven't tried Indigo and are interested in home automation, please give it a shot right

## Installation

This plugin is installed like any other Indigo plugin.  Visit the
[releases](https://github.com/jheddings/indigo-rtoggle/releases) page and download the latest
version.  For advanced users, you may also clone the source tree directly into your Indigo
plugins folder, making updates as easy as pull & reload.

After installing the first time, you will be prompted for the plugin configuration.  You
can also access the plugin config at any time from the Plugins menu.
